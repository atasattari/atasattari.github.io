<!-- BSc in physics and mathematics | University of Toronto | Dark matter search 



I hold a PhD in physics from the University of Toronto. My projects mostly focused on <u>simulations</u>, <u>data analysis</u>, and  <u>statistics</u> for the dark matter search endeavors of the SuperCDMS collaboration. I was lucky to be supervised by:

- [Miriam Diamond](https://mcdonaldinstitute.ca/miriam-diamond/)
- [Ziqing Hong](https://mcdonaldinstitute.ca/app-opportunities/opportunities/ziqing-hong/)
- [Pekka Sinervo](https://sites.physics.utoronto.ca/pekkasinervo)

Before moving to Canada, I got my BSc in physics and mathematics at the University of Tehran. My BSc project focused on aspects of <u>N-point functions in quantum mechanics</u>. I enjoyed learning from

- [Mahdiyar Noorbala](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1058807?ui-citation-summary=true)

Before my physics life, I was a professional swimmer and won multiple national youth tournaments across Iran. I was also an avid Dota2 player for several years and reached rank 800 in North America during COVID.

<!-- I defended my PhD in astroparticle physics at the University of Toronto in Dec 2024 under Prof. [Miriam Diamond](https://mcdonaldinstitute.ca/miriam-diamond/), [Ziqing Hong](https://mcdonaldinstitute.ca/app-opportunities/opportunities/ziqing-hong/), and [Pekka Sinervo](https://sites.physics.utoronto.ca/pekkasinervo). My projects primarily focused on simulations, data analysis, and statistical methods:

- A new [measurement](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.122002) of the ionization yield in germanium.
- Solar axions interaction rate [model](https://www.snolab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SuperCDMS-Axion-like-searches-Ata-Sattari.pdf) for SuperCDMS SNOLAB detectors.
- A search for light dark matter interaction in the lab.
- Development of a novel calibration scheme for silicon cryogenic calorimeters.

I also enjoyed contributing to both the Software and Statistics working groups of the SuperCDMS collaboration:

- Contributed to the development of the first SuperCDMS analysis package in Python under Dr. [Ben Loer](https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=11133) and Prof. [Amy Roberts](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/physics/amy-roberts-phd).
- Provided technical support to construct some statistical inference models in ROOT.
- Gave an introductory lecture on statistics for HEP at the 2024 SuperCDMS Annual Meeting.
