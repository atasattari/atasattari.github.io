        <h1><strong>Hello! This is Ata.</strong></h1>
        <p>I defended my PhD in astroparticle physics at the University of Toronto in Dec 2024 under Prof. <a href="https://mcdonaldinstitute.ca/miriam-diamond/" target="_blank">Miriam Diamond</a>, <a href="https://mcdonaldinstitute.ca/app-opportunities/opportunities/ziqing-hong/" target="_blank">Ziqing Hong</a>, and <a href="https://sites.physics.utoronto.ca/pekkasinervo" target="_blank">Pekka Sinervo</a>. My projects primarily focused on simulations, data analysis, and statistical methods:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A new <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.122002" target="_blank">measurement</a> of the ionization yield in germanium.</li>
            <li>Solar axions interaction rate <a href="https://www.snolab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/SuperCDMS-Axion-like-searches-Ata-Sattari.pdf" target="_blank">model</a> for SuperCDMS SNOLAB detectors.</li>
            <li>A Search for light dark matter interaction in the lab.</li>
            <li>Development of a novel calibration scheme for silicon cryogenic calorimeters.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        I also enjoyed contributing to both the Software and Statistics working groups of the SuperCDMS collaboration:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Contributed to the development of the first SuperCDMS analysis package in Python under Dr. <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/staff_info.asp?staff_num=11133" target="_blank">Ben Loer</a>, and Prof. <a href="https://clas.ucdenver.edu/physics/amy-roberts-phd" target="_blank">Amy Roberts</a>.</li>
            <li> Provided technical support to construct some statistical inference models in ROOT.</li>
            <li> Gave an introductory lecture on statistics for HEP at the 2024 SuperCDMS Annual Meeting.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Prior to my PhD, I got my BSc in physics at the University of Tehran. My BSc project, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1058807?ui-citation-summary=true" target="_blank">Mahdiyar Noorbala</a>, focused on aspects of N-point functions in quantum mechanics.
        </p>
        Before physics, I was a professional swimmer and won multiple national youth tournaments across Iran. I've also been a casual Dota2 esports player, reaching rank 800 in North America during COVID.
